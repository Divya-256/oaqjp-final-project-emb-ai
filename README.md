# Emotion Detection Web Application

This project is a Flask-based web application that uses Embeddable AI libraries to detect emotions in textual input. The app interacts with an AI model to evaluate user-entered statements and determine the intensity of emotions such as anger, joy, fear, sadness, and disgust.
